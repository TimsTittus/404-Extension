# 404 Extension

A little companion for your travels across the web.

Ever wonder how often you land on a "Page Not Found" page? <br>
We all end up in the internet's dead ends from time to time. This simple extension was born out of that curiosity. A small tool to keep a friendly count of those little 404 bumps along the road.

It's not meant to be a big, important tool. It's just a small, quiet counter for anyone who's a little curious about their journey online.

## A Few Simple Things It Does

* **A Gentle Counter:** It quietly keeps track whenever you visit a 404 page. No loud noises or popups, just a simple count.
* **A Quiet Nudge:** The number of lost pages you've found is shown right on the extension's icon, just as a little reminder of your travels.
* **A Fresh Start:** If you ever want to start over, a simple click on the "Reset" button in the popup will set your count back to zero.
* **It Remembers for You:** The count is saved on your computer, so you can close your browser and pick up right where you left off.

## Hereâ€™s How It Looks

It's designed to be simple and out of your way.

**The simple popup with your current count:**
<div align="left" style="padding: 20px;">
  <img src="2.png" alt="Popup showing the count" width="300">
</div>

**The little number on the icon in your toolbar:**
<div align="left" style="padding: 20px;">
  <img src="1.png" alt="Popup showing the count" width="300">
</div>
